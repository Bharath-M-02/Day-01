2.Difference between HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2

HTTP/1.1 was released in 1989 whereas HTTP/2 was released in 2015.
HTTP/1.1 loads the resources one after the other, thereby delay in displaying the information (images, videos, graphics etc).
HTTP/2 loads the resources faster, thereby displaying the information faster than HTTP/1.1
