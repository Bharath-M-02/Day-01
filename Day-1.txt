2.Difference between HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2

*HTTP/1.1 was released in 1989 whereas HTTP/2 was released in 2015.
*HTTP/1.1 loads the resources one after the other, thereby delay in displaying the information (images, videos, graphics etc).
*HTTP/2 loads the resources faster, thereby displaying the information faster than HTTP/1.1

3. Write a blog about objects and its internal representation in Javascript

*Objects are important data types in javascript. Objects are different than primitive datatypes (i.e. number, string, boolean, etc.). 
*Primitive data types contain one value but Objects can hold many values in form of Key: value pair. 
*These keys can be variables or functions and are called properties and methods, respectively, in the context of an object.
